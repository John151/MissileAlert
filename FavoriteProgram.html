            This is my favorite program because working on it I felt like I could actually
            program for the first time. I'm actually not %100 sure it was this program, but it was around
            this time. Everything went from being very confusing to just difficult and time consuming, but
            possible!
            <br>
            This program asks the user for a five digit number, splits the characters, adds them up. I would
            probably do it differently now, but I'm happy with it. There's an unnecessary print statement in a function,
            I think it was to test it and should have been removed.
